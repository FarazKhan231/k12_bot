    Dynamic Flow:
    1) Authentication
       - Login with LAVINIA_USERNAME and LAVINIA_PASSWORD.
       - Validate error handling for invalid/empty input.
       - Confirm dashboard loads with no console errors.
    
    2) Section Discovery
       - Enumerate all visible sections/tabs from the dashboard nav.
       - For each section:
         - Open list view -> confirm items render correctly.
         - Open multiple detail pages (first, last, random).
         - Validate text, media, and forms render.
         - Check search, filters, and pagination (if present).
    
    3) State Exploration
       - Empty list view (if present).
       - Invalid URL -> error page renders.
       - Logged-in vs logged-out restrictions.
    
    4) Cross-Cutting
       - Validate responsiveness (resize browser).
       - Check for broken links/404s.
       - Monitor console for errors/warnings.
       - Verify accessibility basics (labels, keyboard navigation).
    
    Avoid destructive operations (delete, deactivate, purchase).
